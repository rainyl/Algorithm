# Algorithm

## 1. gwo_grnn

This is the code for optimizing the generalized regression neural network by the grey wolf optimization algorithm.

## 2. ga_xaj

This is the code for the basic genetic algorithm to optimize the Xin'anjiang hydrological model. The Xinanjiang model code is written by Dr. Qiu Qi from the University of Science and Technology of China.

## 3. bayes_xaj

This is the Bayesian algorithm to determine the parameters of the Xin'anjiang hydrological model, with reference to some information on the Internet.

## 4.sce_ua_xaj

The new sce_ua algorithm is added to optimize the Xin'anjiang hydrological model. At present, this algorithm is the most suitable optimization algorithm.
